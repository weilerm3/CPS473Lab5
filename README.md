# CPS473 Lab5 Problem 2

Here is the debug hook file for the CPS473 Project. This will allow crack me 2 to work in the cases where it should not
  normally work and it will not work on the cases where it should work.
  
Furthermore, since crack me 2 does not implement ASLR, then this should work on every case of crack me 2 from the file you gave us in class.

This file will set two breakpoints and will print out the input password as well.
